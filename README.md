# Protein Geometry Database

The PGD allows you to explore either protein conformation or protein covalent
geometry or the correlations between protein conformation and bond angles and
lengths.

You can search an up-to-date database of nonredundant protein chains while
selecting chains based on the R value and resolution and filtering residues
based on their average B factor. You can select structural motifs up to 10
residues long with either broad secondary-structure types or fine-grained
ranges of the &Phi; and &psi; dihedral angles. You can additionally restrict
your query by amino acid type, by backbone covalent geometry and/or side chain
conformational angles.

Search results appear on an interactive plot which defaults to a Ramachandran
plot. Any conformational angle, bond length, or bond angle of any of the
residues in the motif can be plotted. The colors can indicate the
observational density or the value of any of the other stereochemical
properties of any other residue.
