<h1>Protein Geometry Database</h1>

<p>
The PGD allows you to explore either protein conformation or protein covalent
geometry or the correlations between protein conformation and bond angles and
lengths.
</p>

<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<td style="width: 50%; text-align: left;">

<p>
You can search an up-to-date database of nonredundant protein chains while
selecting chains based on the R value and resolution and filtering residues
based on their average B factor. You can select structural motifs up to 10
residues long with either broad secondary-structure types or fine-grained
ranges of the &Phi; and &psi; dihedral angles. You can additionally restrict
your query by amino acid type, by backbone covalent geometry and/or side chain
conformatonal angles.
</p>

<p>
Search results appear on an interactive plot which defaults to a Ramachandran
plot. Any conformational angle, bond length, or bond angle of any of the
residues in the motif can be plotted. The colors can indicate the
observational density or the value of any of the other stereochemical
properties of any other residue.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, you can look at statistics broken down by residue type, browse
individual results, or download a plain-text dump of the results. This dump
allows you to pass the output of the PGD into the analysis tool of your
choice, preventing you from being limited by the capabilities of our website
in analyzing your results.
